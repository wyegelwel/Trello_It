Trello_It
=========

A Chrome Extension to make adding cards to Trello accessible from any webpage.

This extension was created to alleviate the annoyance of adding a card to a list with the current tab's URL as a comment. 
Think adding a card to a TODO board with a link to an email as a comment, without switching to Trello. 

You can add cards without the comment as well of course. 


Get the extension
========

Soon the extension will be added to the Google Store, and you can download it there.

If you want to use the extension before then, follow these instructions:

* Download the source files from this repo
* Go to chrome://extensions
* Select Developer mode in the top left corner
* Click 'Load unpacked extension'
* Select the folder where you downloaded the source files
* Enjoy!


Use the extension 
=========
Great, you have the extension running, now how do you use it?
* The first time you use the extension, you will first need to authorize the extension to access your Trello account.
* Next you should see all of your boards and the lists associated with each board
* When you want to make a new card, click the list you want to add the card and fill out the information.
